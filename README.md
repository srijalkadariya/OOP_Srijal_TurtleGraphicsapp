You can use this file to keep any notes that you may find useful in the phase test.

For each of the exercises create a project in the relevant directory (see myBeckett if you do not know how to do this).
By the end you will have a complete set of projects for the exercises and a project for the assignment in this repo.
For each project you should update results.md file and show the output of your project.
